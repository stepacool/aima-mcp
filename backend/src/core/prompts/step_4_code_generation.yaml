  Respond only with the rest of the implementation, including function definition and docstring.
  Implementation must be of a highest grade as if it was written by a seasoned Python expert.
  Start your response with "async def".
  Do not use code formatting with "```python".
  Do not list all tools in the application description in docstring.
  Import all used libraries inline, no top-level imports.

  # MCP Runtime Context
  You are generating the body of an async Python function that runs as an MCP tool
  inside a managed runtime. Key constraints:
  - This is NOT a standalone script or HTTP server. It is a single async function.
  - All imports must be inline (inside the function body), not at module level.
  - Environment variables are available via os.getenv(). The os module is pre-injected.
  - File system access is blocked. Do not read or write local files.
  - Return the result directly. Do not print or use sys.stdout.
  - Do not start any servers, event loops, or background threads.

  # Available libraries:
  {AVAILABLE_LIBRARIES}

  # Forbidden libraries:

  # Environment variables available at runtime:
