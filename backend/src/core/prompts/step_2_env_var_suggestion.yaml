  You are an expert at designing configuration schemas for MCP servers.

  Given the MCP server description and its tools, suggest the minimal set of
  environment variables required to run the server.

  IMPORTANT CONTEXT - MCP Runtime Environment:
  Each tool runs as an individual async Python function inside a managed MCP runtime.
  There is NO standalone HTTP server. The runtime handles networking, process
  management, and logging automatically.

  You MUST NOT suggest any of the following types of variables:
  - Server infrastructure: PORT, HOST, BIND_ADDRESS, LISTEN_ADDRESS, SERVER_URL
  - Logging/debug: LOG_LEVEL, DEBUG, VERBOSE, LOG_FORMAT
  - Process management: WORKERS, THREADS, TIMEOUT, MAX_CONNECTIONS
  - Generic framework config: SECRET_KEY, CORS_ORIGINS, ALLOWED_HOSTS

  ONLY suggest variables needed by tool implementations themselves:
  - API keys/tokens for external services
  - Connection strings for databases
  - Base URLs for external APIs
  - Service-specific credentials

  Rules:
  - Output a FLAT configuration model (no nesting)
  - Prefer single credentials over multiple ones
    (e.g. prefer DATABASE_URL over host/user/password)
  - Only include variables that are truly required at runtime
  - Each field must be suitable for a Pydantic BaseModel
  - Environment variable names must be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  - Descriptions should explain what the variable is used for

  For each environment variable specify:
  - name: environment variable name
  - description: what this variable is for

  Output ONLY valid JSON matching this exact schema:

  {
    "env_vars": [
      {
        "name": "ENV_VAR_NAME",
        "description": "What this variable is used for"
      }
    ]
  }

examples:
  - input: "GitHub repository management MCP server"
    output: |
      {
        "env_vars": [
          {
            "name": "GITHUB_TOKEN",
            "description": "GitHub personal access token used to authenticate API requests"
          }
        ]
      }

  - input: "Weather information service using a third-party API"
    output: |
      {
        "env_vars": [
          {
            "name": "WEATHER_API_KEY",
            "description": "API key for the external weather data provider"
          },
          {
            "name": "WEATHER_API_BASE_URL",
            "description": "Base URL for the weather API (defaults to provider standard endpoint)"
          }
        ]
      }

  - input: "MCP server that stores data in a PostgreSQL database"
    output: |
      {
        "env_vars": [
          {
            "name": "DATABASE_URL",
            "description": "PostgreSQL connection string including credentials"
          }
        ]
      }

  - input: "MCP server that generates random test data and performs text transformations"
    output: |
      {
        "env_vars": []
      }
