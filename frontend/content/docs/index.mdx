## Introduction
MCPHero is a managed platform and **Auto MCP** solution for building MCP servers using AI (aka *vibecode*) and deploying them in one click.
It’s inspired by platforms like **v0** and **Lovable**, but functions as a specialized **MCP Generator** for model context protocol servers.

## How MCPHero Works

MCPHero is built around a structured AI Chat UI.
Instead of a free-form chat, the AI follows a strict, step-by-step flow:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Conversation Step

A natural conversation where the AI guides the user and understands **what kind of MCP server is needed**.
</Step>

<Step>
### Tool Selection Step

The AI suggests a set of tools based on the conversation.
The user then selects which tools should be included in the MCP server.
</Step>

<Step>
### Values Step

If the MCP server requires credentials, connection strings, or other runtime values, the AI will ask for them explicitly in this step.
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Step

The final step defines **where and how the MCP server is deployed**.
Available deployment options depend on the user's plan.
An API key is automatically generated for your server.
</Step>
</Steps>

This rigid structure significantly reduces AI hallucinations and limits room for error, ensuring generated MCP server can be successfully run.

## Servers

MCPHero supports multiple deployment options depending on your plan.

**Shared Runtime**
: A managed, shared environment designed for experimentation and the free tier.
- Shared compute and limited resources
- No ephemeral credentials or runtime-injected values
- Limited, whitelisted Python libraries
- Free tier only

**Dedicated VPS**
: A fully isolated environment with maximum flexibility and control.
- Dedicated compute resources
- Ephemeral credentials and arbitrary runtime values supported
- Full freedom over code and dependencies
- Paid plans only
