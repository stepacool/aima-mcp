## Introduction

Fumadocs (Foo-ma docs) is a **documentation framework** based on Next.js, designed to be fast, flexible, and composes seamlessly into Next.js App Router.

Fumadocs has different parts:

### Fumadocs Core

Handles most of the logic, including document search, content source adapters, and Markdown extensions.

### Fumadocs UI

The default theme of Fumadocs offers a beautiful look for documentation sites and interactive components.

### Content Source

The source of your content, can be a CMS or local data layers like [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev) and Fumadocs MDX, the official content source.

### Fumadocs CLI

A command line tool to install UI components and automate things, useful for customizing layouts.

### Terminology

**Markdown/MDX:** Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text. Fumadocs supports Markdown and MDX (superset of Markdown) out-of-the-box.

Although not required, some basic knowledge of Next.js App Router would be useful for further customisations.

## Automatic Installation

<Callout type="warn">
A minimum version of Node.js 18 required, note that Node.js 23.1 might have problems with Next.js production build.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash
npm create fumadocs-app
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="yarn">
```bash
yarn create fumadocs-app
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="bun">
```bash
bun create fumadocs-app
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

It will ask you the framework and content source to use, a new fumadocs app should be initialized. Now you can start hacking!

<Callout title="From Existing Codebase?">
You can follow the [Manual Installation](/docs/manual-installation) guide to get started.
</Callout>

### Enjoy!

Create your first MDX file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Explore

In the project, you can see:

- `lib/source.ts`: Code for content source adapter, `loader()` provides an interface to interact with your content source, and assigns URL to your pages.
- `app/layout.config.tsx`: Shared options for layouts, optional but preferred to keep.

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `app/(home)` | The route group for your landing page and other pages. |
| `app/docs` | The documentation layout and pages. |
| `app/api/search/route.ts` | The Route Handler for search. |
