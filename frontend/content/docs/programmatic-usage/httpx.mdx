title: MCP with httpx
description: Call MCP tools directly using raw HTTP requests
---

## Overview

You can access your MCP server directly over HTTP using standard Python clients.
This approach gives you full control and zero framework overhead.

---

## Authentication

All requests must include your API key as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

---

## Calling Tools

```python
import httpx

MCP_URL = "https://mcphero.app/mcp/{server_id}"
API_KEY = "your-api-key"

async def call_mcp_tool(tool_name: str, arguments: dict):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            f"{MCP_URL}/tools/call",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"},
            json={"name": tool_name, "arguments": arguments},
        )
        return response.json()

result = await call_mcp_tool(
    "get_customer_by_name",
    {"name": "John Smith"}
)

print(result)
```
