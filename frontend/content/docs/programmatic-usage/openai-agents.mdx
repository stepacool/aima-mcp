title: MCP with OpenAI Agents
description: Use MCP tools with the OpenAI Responses / Agents API
---

## Overview

MCP integrates cleanly with OpenAI Agents, allowing models to call your MCP tools
as native function calls via the Responses API.

---

## Connecting MCP

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from mcp import MCPClient

client = OpenAI()

mcp = MCPClient(
    server_url="https://mcphero.app/mcp/{server_id}",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your-api-key>"
    },
)
```

---

## Running an Agent

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=mcp.tools(),
    input="Find customer John Smith and summarize their account"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

## Why OpenAI Agents

- Native function calling
- Best-in-class model support
- Ideal for tool-heavy workflows
