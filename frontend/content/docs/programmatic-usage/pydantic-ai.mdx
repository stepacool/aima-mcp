## Overview

Pydantic AI has native MCP support, allowing agents to automatically discover
and invoke tools exposed by your MCP server.

## Connecting to MCP

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerHTTP

mcp_server = MCPServerHTTP(
    url="https://mcphero.app/mcp/{server_id}",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your-api-key>"
    },
)
```

## Creating an Agent

agent = Agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4",
    mcp_servers=[mcp_server],
)
```

## Running the Agent

result = await agent.run(
    "Find customer John Smith and return their last order"
)

print(result.data)
```
