## Architecture

### Page Tree

Navigation elements like sidebar take a Page Tree to render navigation links, it's a tree that describes all available pages and folders.

Normally, it is generated from your file structure using `loader()`, you can learn how to organize pages.

## Customisation

### Layouts

You can use the exposed options of different layouts:

<Cards>
<Card title="Docs Layout" href="/docs/overview">
Layout for docs
</Card>
<Card title="Docs Page" href="/docs/overview">
Layout for docs content
</Card>
<Card title="Notebook Layout" href="/docs/overview">
A more compact version of Docs Layout
</Card>
<Card title="Home Layout" href="/docs/overview">
Layout for other pages
</Card>
</Cards>

### Components

Fumadocs UI also offers styled components for interactive examples to enhance your docs, you can customise them with exposed props like `style` and `className`.

See [Components](/docs/components).

### Design System

Since the design system is built on Tailwind CSS, you can customise it with CSS Variables.

### CLI

If none of them suits you, Fumadocs CLI is a tool to install Fumadocs UI components and layouts to your codebase, similar to Shadcn UI. Allowing you to fully customise Fumadocs UI:

```bash
npx fumadocs add
