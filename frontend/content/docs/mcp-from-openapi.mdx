# MCP from OpenAPI

One of the most powerful features of MCPHero is the ability to function as an **MCP from OpenAPI** generator. If you have an existing REST API with an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification, you can turn it into a full-featured MCP server in seconds.

## How it Works

MCPHero's AI can ingest OpenAPI specifications to understand your API's endpoints, parameters, and authentication requirements. It then functions as an **Auto MCP** generator, creating the necessary tools to expose those endpoints to AI clients.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Provide the OpenAPI URL**: In the Chat UI, simple provide the URL to your `openapi.json` or `swagger.yaml` file.
2. **AI Analysis**: Our **MCP Generator** analyzes the schema and proposes a set of MCP tools that map to your API endpoints.
3. **Selection**: Choose which endpoints you want to expose as tools.
4. **Configuration**: Provide any required API keys or base URLs.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy your new MCP server with one click.

## Benefits of MCP from OpenAPI

- **Speed**: Go from an existing API to a live MCP server in minutes.
- **Accuracy**: Automatically generated tool definitions based on your exact API schema.
- **Managed**: No need to host the translation layer yourself; MCPHero handles it all.

## Use Cases

- **Internal Tools**: Expose your internal company APIs to Cursor or Claude for faster development.
- **Product Integrations**: Allow users of your API to use it via their favorite AI assistants.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly test how your API performs as a set of AI tools.

By using MCPHero as your **MCP Generator**, you bridge the gap between traditional REST APIs and the new world of Model Context Protocol.
