Fumadocs was created because I wanted a more customisable experience for building docs, to be a docs framework that is not opinionated, **a "framework" that you can break**.

## Philosophy

**Less Abstraction:** Fumadocs expects you to write code and cooperate with the rest of your software. While most frameworks are configured with a configuration file, they usually lack flexibility when you hope to tune its details. You can't control how they render the page nor the internal logic. Fumadocs shows you how the app works, instead of a single configuration file.

**Next.js Fundamentals:** It gives you the utilities and a good-looking UI. You are still using features of Next.js App Router, like **Static Site Generation**. There is nothing new for Next.js developers, so you can use it with confidence.

**Opinionated on UI:** The only thing Fumadocs UI (the default theme) offers is **User Interface**. The UI is opinionated for bringing better mobile responsiveness and user experience. Instead, we use a much more flexible approach inspired by Shadcn UI — Fumadocs CLI, so we can iterate our design quick, and welcome for more feedback about the UI.

## Why Fumadocs

Fumadocs is designed to be:

1. **Fast** - Built on Next.js App Router with full support for React Server Components
2. **Flexible** - You have full control over the layout and components
3. **Beautiful** - Clean, modern UI with dark mode support out of the box
4. **Developer-friendly** - Great DX with TypeScript, hot reload, and more

## Documentation

Fumadocs is perfect for:

- Open source project documentation
- Product documentation
- API references
- Knowledge bases
- Internal wikis

## Blog Sites

While Fumadocs is primarily designed for documentation, you can also use it for blog sites with some customization.

## When to Use Fumadocs

Consider using Fumadocs when you:

- Need a documentation site that integrates well with your Next.js app
- Want full control over the design and layout
- Prefer writing in MDX with great syntax highlighting
- Need features like search, table of contents, and navigation
- Want a fast, SEO-friendly documentation site
