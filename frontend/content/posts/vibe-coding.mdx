# The Rise of Vibe Coding

There's a new term floating around engineering Twitter: "Vibe Coding." It sounds silly, but it describes a very real shift in how we build software.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is the practice of building software where the primary constraint is your ability to describe what you want, rather than your ability to write the syntax to achieve it. It's about maintaining a flow state - the "vibe" - without getting bogged down in boilerplate, configuration or syntax errors.

With tools like Cursor, Claude Code and Antigravity, developers act more like conductors than instrumentalists. We direct the AI to generate the code and we refine, guide and correct it until it matches our vision.

## From Syntax to Semantics

Traditionally, a huge chunk of a developer's brain power was dedicated to remembering syntax. How do I center a div? What's the argument order for `reduce`? How do I configure Webpack?

In the era of vibe coding, those questions are irrelevant. Powered by next-generation models like Opus, Gemini and GLM, the AI handles the "how." You focus on the "what" and the "why."

## Speed is a Feature

The most immediate benefit is speed. Features that used to take days now take hours. Side projects that would have died in the "I'll set up the repo later" phase now get built in a weekend.

But it's not just about typing faster. It's about **iteration velocity**. You can try an idea, see it's bad, scrap it and try another one in the time it used to take just to install dependencies.

## Achromatic and Vibe Coding

We built Achromatic to be the perfect foundation for vibe coding. It's opinionated, type-safe and structured in a way that LLMs understand. Because we use standard technologies like Next.js, tRPC and Tailwind, the AI models are incredibly good at generating code for it.

You provide the vision. The AI writes the code. Achromatic provides the bedrock.
