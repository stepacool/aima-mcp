<objective>
Update the comparison section with 2 new competitor tables (vs Manufact, vs Composio) and fix pricing in both the comparison tables and JSON-LD structured data.

Purpose: Provide fair, comprehensive comparison for new competitors while ensuring pricing consistency across the landing page.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix HasMCP pricing in comparison table</name>
  <files>frontend/components/landing/comparison.tsx</files>
  <action>
    In the existing vs HasMCP comparison table (line 53-63), update the Pro Pricing row:
    - Change mcphero value from "$19/seat" to "$59/mo"
    - Change competitor value from "$24/seat" to "$59/mo"
    
    Also update the Free Tier row:
    - Change mcphero value from "Unlimited" to "1 server, 3 tools"
    
    This aligns with user decision: "Fix HasMCP: $59/mo (not $19/seat)" and "Fix free tier: 1 server, 3 tools"
  </action>
  <verify>Read the comparison.tsx file and verify the vs HasMCP table now shows $59/mo for both columns and "1 server, 3 tools" for free tier</verify>
  <done>HasMCP comparison table shows $59/mo for Pro Pricing and 1 server, 3 tools for free tier</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add vs Manufact comparison table</name>
  <files>frontend/components/landing/comparison.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Append a new comparison table entry to the comparisonTables array AFTER the existing 4 tables (after vs HasMCP):
    
    {
      title: "vs Manufact",
      subtitle: "YC-backed. 8K+ GitHub stars. But is it truly no-code?",
      rows: [

        { feature: "AI Generation", mcphero: true, competitor: "Limited" },
        { feature: "Dedicated VPS", mcphero: true, competitor: false },
        { feature: "Pricing", mcphero: "$59/mo flat", competitor: "Enterprise" },
        { feature: "Setup Time", mcphero: "Minutes", competitor: "Hours" },
      ],
    }
    
    Key differentiators to highlight: truly no-code, any input, dedicated VPS, transparent pricing
  </action>
  <verify>Verify comparisonTables array now has 5 entries and includes the vs Manufact table with correct rows</verify>
  <done>vs Manufact comparison table added as 5th entry in comparisonTables array</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add vs Composio comparison table</name>
  <files>frontend/components/landing/comparison.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Append another comparison table entry AFTER vs Manufact:
    
    {
      title: "vs Composio",
      subtitle: "500+ integrations. But what about custom tools?",
      rows: [

        { feature: "Setup Time", mcphero: "Minutes", competitor: "Days" },
      ],
    }
    
    Focus: Composio is code-first despite some no-code features, focus on custom/unconventional integrations
  </action>
  <verify>Verify comparisonTables array now has 6 entries and includes both vs Manufact and vs Composio in correct order</verify>
  <done>vs Composio comparison table added as 6th (last) entry in comparisonTables array</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Fix JSON-LD structured data pricing</name>
  <files>frontend/app/(marketing)/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    In the ProductJsonLd function, update the offers array:
    
    1. Free Plan description: Change from "Free tier for experimentation with up to 3 tools" to "Free tier: 1 server, 3 tools, community support"
    
    2. Pro Plan: 
       - Change price from "29" to "59"
       - Change description from "Dedicated VPS, unlimited tools, up to 5 MCP servers, ephemeral env vars, OAuth" to "Dedicated VPS, unlimited tools, 5 MCP servers, ephemeral env vars, priority support"
    
    This aligns MCPHero pricing to $59/mo consistent with the comparison table updates.
  </action>
  <verify>Read page.tsx and verify ProductJsonLd shows correct pricing: Free = "1 server, 3 tools", Pro = $59</verify>
  <done>JSON-LD shows correct free tier (1 server, 3 tools) and Pro Plan ($59/mo)</done>

1. Compare the comparisonTables array length: should be 6 (4 original + 2 new)
2. Verify table order: Self-Hosting, FastMCP, Official SDK, HasMCP, Manufact, Composio
3. Verify HasMCP pricing in comparison: $59/mo for both columns
4. Verify free tier in comparison: "1 server, 3 tools"
5. Verify JSON-LD pricing matches: Free = "1 server, 3 tools", Pro = $59
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Comparison section displays 6 tables in correct order
- HasMCP pricing shows $59/mo in comparison table
- JSON-LD free tier shows "1 server, 3 tools"
- JSON-LD Pro Plan shows $59/month
- All key differentiators (any input, no code required, dedicated VPS, pricing transparency) are highlighted in new tables
