# Phase 4: Hero Section Updates - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Update the existing hero section's headline, subheadline, and social proof to align with MCPHero's key differentiators: "No API docs" messaging and "any input" capability. Maintain existing visual structure and animations.

## Implementation Decisions

### Headline Wording
- Keep existing headline: "Ship MCP Servers in Minutes, Not Weeks"
- Do NOT add "No API docs?" to main headline - keeps it punchy and non-qualified
- The "No API docs" messaging goes in the subheadline instead

### Input Examples (Subheadline)
- List all 4 input types as examples: cURL, SQL schema, HTML, plain English
- Emphasize these are just examples - "literally anything can be provided"
- Wording: "Connect any database, API, or tool — even without documentation. cURL, SQL schema, HTML, or plain English. Anything works."

### Social Proof
- Remove social proof from hero section entirely
- Current situation: low GitHub stars, almost no customers yet
- Better to not show weak numbers than to show specific low counts
- Social proof (testimonials, logos) will be addressed in Phase 7 (Social Proof Expansion)

### Content Updates Summary
- Hero headline: Keep "Ship MCP Servers in Minutes, Not Weeks"
- Hero subheadline: Update to emphasize "No API docs" + "any input" capability
- Hero social proof: Remove entirely from hero section

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- The key differentiator message: "No API docs? No problem." - but in subheadline, not headline
- Input examples are illustrative - the point is "literally anything can be provided"
- Trust section coming later (Phase 6-7) will handle company logos and testimonials

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Company logos → Phase 6/7 (Trust Section)
- Testimonials → Phase 7 (Social Proof Expansion)
- GitHub stars display → Phase 6 (Trust Section)
