  <files>frontend/components/landing/hero.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Update the hero.tsx component with the following changes:

    1. **Keep existing headline** (line 21): "Ship MCP Servers in Minutes, Not Weeks" - NO changes

    2. **Update subheadline** (line 31): Replace with exact text:
    "Connect any database, API, or tool — even without documentation. cURL, SQL schema, HTML, or plain English. Anything works."

    3. **Remove social proof section** (lines 56-72): Delete the entire social proof div including the Star icons and "Trusted by 2,000+ developers" text. Keep the CTAs and product visual intact.

    Keep all existing motion animations and visual structure unchanged.
  </action>

    Read the updated file and verify:
    - Headline is unchanged: "Ship MCP Servers in Minutes, Not Weeks"
    - Subheadline matches: "Connect any database, API, or tool — even without documentation. cURL, SQL schema, HTML, or plain English. Anything works."
    - Social proof section (Star icons + text) is removed
    - Motion animations on Headline, Subheadline, CTAs are preserved
  </verify>
  <done>
