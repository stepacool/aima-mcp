This project is "MCPHERO" / mcphero.app

The core idea is generation of MCP servers + deployment, all managed for you. 
Managed MCP servers/lovable for mcp servers etc.

There's an AI wizard that guides you step by step to setup your MCP server:
1. Describe/ask around - what kind of mcp server the user wants to get
2. Suggest some tools
3. Setup env vars
4. Generate code
5. Deploy

The servers support oauth2.0 and Authentication Bearer auth.
